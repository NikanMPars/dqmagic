# dqmagic

The goal of dqmagic is to provide an R interface to the libmagic library for
determining the type of a file based on its content.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to determine the type of a file:

```{r example}
library(dqmagic)
file_type("DESCRIPTION")
file_type("src/file.cpp")
```
